#Introduction

The Benchmark Data Library Project introduces a new way to approach
the design and generation of artificial data. It is not primarily 
aimed to be a dedicated data generator - it rather provides a 
framework to enable the researcher to efficiently code 
easily understandable and reproducible artificial data. The 
entire concept is based on the notion of merely working with 
a standardized format for the metadata. All information that is 
needed for actual data generation is found in a single .R file, 
the format of which is strictly prescribed.

#How can I get data?

That depends on whether you have a suitable .R file. You can either 
obtain one from the metadata repository that serves as a common place
to share benchmarking setups ([BDLP Repository](https://rdangl.shinyapps.io/bdlp_2/)). If
you do not have such a file, you need to write one yourself - the package 
does not provide an implementation that allows immediate data generation by 
just calling a function and passing a few arguments. A .R file (which shall 
be called setup file in the following) is absolutely necessary.

If you have a setup file - such a file containing a VERY simple benchmarking
setup that consists of two simple metric 2d datasets is included in the package
and can be sourced with

```{r}
library(bdlp)
source(system.file("dangl2014.R", package = "bdlp"))
```

The file only contains one function which has to be of the same name 
as the file name - always authorYEAR. If several benchmarking setups 
are available for the same author in one year, additional indication of 
this fact by authorYEARa/b/c/etc. are permissible. This function can return 
two things; either a summary about the setup:

```{r}
dangl2014(info=T)
```

or a metadata object of one of the two available datasets. This is 
done by merely providing the the set nr and results in the following object:

```{r}
library(MASS)
meta <- dangl2014(setnr=1)
meta
```

The object consists of several slots. Most importantly, the slot `genfunc`
contains the random number generating function (in this case the default `mvrnorm`).
The second important slot is `clusters`, which contains the parameters that are needed by 
`genfunc` to generate data. It is important to notice that the parameters in `clusters` are
identical to the arguments needed by `genfunc`. Two other slots are quite crucial for 
processing the metadata object: `metaseedinfo` and `seedinfo`. The former sets the random number 
generator parameters for the purpose of calculating the metadata object. For example, if the 
cluster centers were to be chosen randomly and not in a fixed way like in the case at hand, the 
`metaseedinfo` parameters ensure reproducibility of a particular metadata object. The latter, 
`seedinfo`, is information that is sent along with the metadata object to the the function that 
generates the actual random numbers of the dataset. It can be practical to have these two sets 
of random number generator parameters - if not needed, they default to the same set of arguments.
Therefore, if a metadata object has been created, one can generate the actual numbers. This can 
be done for one single data set from this particular metadata scenario by

```{r}
library(MASS)
data <- generateData(meta)
head(data)
```

If a different random number seed is needed this can be done by

```{r}
meta <- dangl2014(1, seedinfo = list(120, "3.1.3", c("Mersenne-Twister", "Inversion")))
data <- generateData(meta)
head(data)
```

This data can then be plotted with the commonly used plot functions. Yet still, 
it is also possible to catch a glimpse of the structure of the data by plotting a metadata 
object directly. For this purpose, an instance of the dataset is generated automatically, which
saves a few steps in-between.

```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center'}
meta <- dangl2014(setnr=1)
plotMetadata(meta)
```

However, generally one may require for benchmarking purposes a large 
number of datasets drawn from one particular metadata scenario. This 
works as follows:

```{r results="hide", message=F, warning=F}
generateDatabase(name = system.file("dangl2014.R", package = "bdlp"), setnr = 1, draws = 50)
```

Which creates an SQLite database in the current working directory that contains 
50 datasets drawn from matadata object 1 of the setup name. Of course, `metaseedinfo` and 
`seedinfo` is also available here. The random number seed starts at a certain base value 
(default 100) and increments by 1 for each draw. Therefore draw number 1 uses seed 101, etc. 
If a different increment step is desired, one can set the argument `increment` to this value.

#How does it work?

In order to explore the concept in more depth we look at the function body that is in the 
included setup file:

```{r}
dangl2014 <- function(setnr = NULL, 
                      seedinfo = list(100, 
                                      paste(R.version$major, R.version$minor, sep = "."),
                                      RNGkind()), 
                      info = FALSE, 
                      metaseedinfo = list(100, 
                                          paste(R.version$major, R.version$minor, sep = "."),
                                          RNGkind())){

  inf <- data.frame(n = c(50, 40), k = c(2,2), shape = c("spherical", "spherical"))
  ref <- "Dangl R. (2014) A small simulation study. Journal of Simple Datasets 10(2), 1-10"
  if(info == T) return(list(summary = inf, reference = ref))

  if(is.null(metaseedinfo)) metaseedinfo <- seedinfo

  set.seed(metaseedinfo[[1]])
  RNGversion(metaseedinfo[[2]])
  RNGkind(metaseedinfo[[3]][1], metaseedinfo[[3]][2])

  if(setnr == 1) {
    return(new("metadata.metric", 
      clusters = list(c1 = list(n = 25, mu = c(4,5), Sigma=diag(1,2)),
                      c2 = list(n = 25, mu = c(-1,-2), Sigma=diag(1,2))),
      genfunc = MASS::mvrnorm, seedinfo = seedinfo))
  }
  if(setnr == 2){
    return(new("metadata.metric", 
      clusters = list(c1 = list(n = 20, mu = c(0,2), Sigma=diag(1,2)),
                      c2 = list(n = 20, mu = c(-1,-2), Sigma=diag(1,2))),
      genfunc = MASS::mvrnorm, seedinfo = seedinfo))
  }
}
```

Again, we can see that the first part of the function provides the information output 
that has already been described above. The second half of the function specifies the 
metadata objects. The function arguments are fixed and must not be changed. In the middle, 
the metaseedinfo parameters are applied in case random effects are used in metadata generation, 
and the seedinfo parameters are passed on to the metadata object output. This is certainly 
a simple example; much more complex scenarios can be realised. The package functions
merely assemble the dataset based on the parameters supplied in the setup file cluster by cluster. 
Therefore, any random number generating function of any R package can be used. Still, also 
custom functions written from scratch can be used and included in the setup file. The only 
strict limitation that is imposed on the setup file is that the main function that is then 
used for data generation must produce the metadata files according to the structure defined in 
the package.

#How can I write a new benchmarking setup?

Essentially, by writing a new setup file that complies with a few important rules:

* the file name in the already mentioned format authorYEAR
* the file has to contain at least one function with the same name as the setup file
* the arguments of the main function are prescribed (setnr, seedinfo, info, metaseedinfo - 
exactly like in the example function above)
* the main function has to return an info table and a reference if argument `info = T`, or 
a metadata object (for a specific `setnr` and `metaseedinfo`)
* should auxiliary functions be included in the setup file, it is strongly advised to 
name them in the format `authorYear_myfunc` in order to avoid conflicts with other setup files 
which could coincidentally contain identically named functions

At the moment, 5 types of metadata objects are supported: metric, ordinal, binary, functional and 
random string data. It is of course possible to have several types of metadata in a 
benchmarking setup. At the moment it is not yet possible to have a metadata object that
mixes several types of data in one dataset (e.g. some metric, ordinal and binary variables), 
but support for this is planned for the next release.

The setup file does not need to be created completely from scratch; two function can 
do that to different degrees. Function `createFileskeleton` creates a blank template that 
fills in the most important information (function names, arguments, return values etc.). 
A much more convenient solution is saveSetup - if several metadata objects have been created 
(this in turn can be done with the help of `initializeObject`), a setup file can be written 
to the disk without any further action necessary. It can be used immediately for data generation.
A simple example looks as follows:

```{r results="hide", message=F, warning=F}
require(MASS)
m1 <- initializeObject(type = "metric", genfunc = mvrnorm, k = 2)
m1@clusters$cl1 <- list(n = 25, mu = c(4,5), Sigma = diag(1,2))
m1@clusters$cl2 <- list(n = 25, mu = c(-1,-2), Sigma = diag(1,2))

m2 <- initializeObject(type = "metric", genfunc = mvrnorm, k = 2)
m2@clusters$cl1 <- list(n = 44, mu = c(1,2), Sigma = diag(1,2))
m2@clusters$cl2 <- list(n = 66, mu = c(-5,-6), Sigma = diag(1,2))

saveSetup(name="miller2012.R", author="Mister Miller", mail="mister.miller@edu.com",
            inst="Unknown University", cit="Simple Data, pp. 23-24", objects=list(m1, m2),
            table=data.frame(n = c(50, 110), k = c(2,2), shape = c("spherical", "spherical")))

generateDatabase(name = "miller2012.R", setnr = 1, draws = 20)
```

The procedure is basically identical for ordinal, binary and random string data. Functional 
data requires a structurally quite different metadata object. It is advised to have a look at 
the class description for functional metadata in the package manual. An example for functional 
data works as follows:

```{r}
Fun1 <- function(x){x^2}
Fun2 <- function(x){sqrt(x)}
Fun3 <- function(x){sin(2*pi*x)}
functions <- list(Fun1 = Fun1, Fun2 = Fun2, Fun3 = Fun3)

interval <- c(0,1)
gridPoints <- 30

sd <- 0.2
n <- 100
minTimePoints <- 5
maxTimePoints <- 10
regular <- FALSE

grid <- sampleGrid(n, minTimePoints, maxTimePoints, gridPoints, regular)

meta <- new("metadata.functional", functions = functions, 
                                   gridMatrix = grid,
                                   sd=sd,
                                   sd_distribution="rnorm",
                                   interval = interval, 
                                   resolution=gridPoints,
                                   total_n = n, 
                                   minTimePoints = minTimePoints, 
                                   maxTimePoints = maxTimePoints, 
                                   regular=F)

data <- generateData(meta)
head(data)
```

#Storing and sharing setup files

New setup files that are used in actual benchmarking studies can be added to the repository of 
the Benchmark Data Library Project (link above), which is highly appreciated! This might greatly 
help other researchers who like to use artificial data in their studies and who do not want to 
reinvent the wheel. Furthermore, benchmarking studies are much more meaningful if methods can 
be compared on the exact same data from another study. This is actually one of the major effects 
that are intended to come along with using this package.
